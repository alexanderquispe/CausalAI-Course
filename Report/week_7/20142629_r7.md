# Estimating treatment effects with causal forests: An Application

The work is about the national study learning with the purpose to evaluate the impact of nudge intervention designed to instill students with a growth mindset. The analysis is based on data about 10,391 observations. We have the next questions: 

1. Was the mindset intervention effective in improving student achievment? 
2. Was the effectt of the intervention moderated by school level achievment or pre-existing mindset? 
3. Do other covariates participate in the process? 

The students in the studdy are no following a independently sampled, they are choosen randomly, besides we have heterogenety across schools. We have some importants points like if we have to give more weight in schools where we observe more studdents. When we work with claustered data we adapt the random fores algorithm, we draw a sample of clusters of the model. 

Causal forests for observational studies 
Causal forest are implemented in grd can be motivated as prediction made by individual trees, but we can think in random forests as an adaptative kernel method. 

Workshop results 
The first questions is about the overall effectiveness of the intervention, the next 2 questions is about the heterogeneity, the first method involves grouping observations, the second method is motivated by the best linear predictor. 

Finally we have the discussion about the desig and treatment propensities, if we properly make a deeper discussion of how to work with clustered observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity, besides we have that in a non parametric setting the clusters have an additive effect on Yi.
